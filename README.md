# articles-react
Articles is a small app where registered users can upload articles about whatever they want.

The user can watch an article board, create articles, edit, delete, sign in, sign up, logout.

This app is built with ReactJs, but it'll also have an Angular and React Native version.

Why?

1) It's a great resource for developers that are looking for nice working examples about the frontend software mentioned before.

2) I've been learning those frameworks since a while but I hadn't done something cool with it. So here it is, and of course, it'll be part of my portfolio.

What are you going to find on "articles-react"?

- Example of good usage of ReactJs.
- Redux (app state, actions, reducers, handle side effects with Redux-Saga, etc.)
- Redux-Form usage.
- ES6.
- Routing (Protected Routes, Child Routes, etc.)
- Helpers.
- Firebase usage.
- And much much more!
